# A STUDY OF LITHIUM-ION TRANSPORT IN PVDF-HFP BASED PIEZIOIONIC MEMBRANES WITH A BINARY CARBONATE SOLVENT MIX

The culmination of 8 months of work, I hope you enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing. This project was me stepping outisde of my comfort zone into the realm of pure materials science. My question, why does LiTFSI maintain such high conductivity and lithium ion diffusivity at ultra high concentrations (3M), and will this effect be maintained with other solvent mixes.  

Turns out, flourophilic interactions between the TFSI anion and the PVDF-HFP polymer backbone have been obesrved to modify the solubility of TFSI, and are believed to prevent ion pairing between Li and TFSI at high concetrations. By adding a second low viscosity solvent into the solvnet mix, I was able to enhance conductivity by 38%, diffusion coefficients by 50% and reducing 80% of lithium waste in sample production. However, the diuluent solvent had a rather high miscibility with PVDF-HFP, which I beleive contributed to the poor mechanichal properties of my membrane formulation.
